### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Willian Duarte de Andrade.

I'm an experienced software engineer with over 15 years of experience in the field.

I'm currently focused on developing back-end systems using Go, but I have experience with a wide range of technologies, including C#, Python, JavaScript, and also front-end technologies like React.

I'm also experienced with cloud computing, having worked with Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.
